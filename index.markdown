I am a researcher in [**Research Unit  5757:  Weak Elements in Phonology**](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/531445091?language=en), [**Project WE 5 - Unlearning distributions of weak elements: Evidence from German-Turkish learners of L3 French**](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/556832628?language=en) based at the University of Mainz.

My research focuses on the production and perception of prosodic prominence. During my doctoral studies, I have been particularly interested in inter-individual variability in the use of prominence. Recently, I have developed an interest in multimodal prosody and the contribution of gestures to prominence marking.
