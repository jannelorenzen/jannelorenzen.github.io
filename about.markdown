I am currently a researcher at the University of Mainz in [Project WE 5 - Unlearning distributions of weak elements: Evidence from German-Turkish learners of L3 French](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/556832628?language=en) as part of the [Research Unit  5757:  Weak Elements in Phonology](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/531445091?language=en).

Previously, I was a doctoral student and researcher in [Project A07](https://sfb1252.uni-koeln.de/projekte/a07-metrical-prominence/) at the CRC 1252 - Prominence in Language in Cologne. I completed my doctoral dissertation on individual differences in prominence production and perception in December 2024.

Before starting my doctoral studies at the University of Cologne, I studied General and Applied Linguistics at the University of WÃ¼rzburg and Empirical Linguistics and English studies at the University of Kiel.
