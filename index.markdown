I am a researcher at the CRC1252 - Prominence in Language, [Project A07](https://sfb1252.uni-koeln.de/projekte/a07-metrical-prominence/).

My research focuses on the production and perception of prosodic prominence. During my doctoral studies, I have been particularly interested in inter-individual variability in the use of prominence. Recently, I have developed an interest in multimodal prosody and the contribution of gestures to prominence marking.
