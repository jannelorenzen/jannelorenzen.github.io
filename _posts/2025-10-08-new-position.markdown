Big news! Last week I started my new position at the University of Mainz in [**Project WE 5 - Unlearning distributions of weak elements: Evidence from German-Turkish learners of L3 French**](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/556832628?language=en) as part of the [**Research Unit  5757:  Weak Elements in Phonology**](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/531445091?language=en). I am especially excited to return to working on Turkish prosody, a topic that I have been interested in since my Master's studies at the University of WÃ¼rzburg.
