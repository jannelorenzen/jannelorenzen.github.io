I am a researcher at the CRC1252 - Prominence in Language, [Project A07](https://sfb1252.uni-koeln.de/projekte/a07-metrical-prominence/). I completed my doctoral dissertation on individual differences in prominence production and perception in December 2024.

Before starting my doctoral studies at the University of Cologne, I studied General and Applied Linguistics at the University of WÃ¼rzburg and Empirical Linguistics and English studies at the University of Kiel.
